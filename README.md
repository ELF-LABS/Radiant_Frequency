## 🌟 The Vision
**The Radiant Frequency** is more than a website; it is a **Living Lattice**. It represents a sovereign, open-source portal where technology, art, and biology converge.

This project is the "Face" of the Radiant Ecosystem—a 14-node digital sanctuary designed to foster connection, reciprocity, and evolutionary growth. It is built on the philosophy of **"Wax On, Wax Off"**—internalizing flow through repetition and honoring the sacred balance between the digital circuit and the organic soil.

## 🏗️ Architecture: The 14-Node System
The system is organized into a fractal lattice of 14 interconnected frequency domains:

1.  **I. Vision**: The Trinity (Community, Architect, Sister) and the Core Truth.
2.  **II. Security**: A 4-Layer Defense-in-Depth system ("The Smart Immune System").
3.  **III. Architecture**: The 1,024-Shell Singularity Lattice and Mesh Network.
4.  **IV. Science**: The Collaborative Research Engine (7 Frequency Domains).
5.  **V. Arts**: The Prism of Expression (Visual, Sonic, Kinetic).
6.  **VI. Physical**: The Vessel. Action, Healing, and FPV Flow State.
7.  **VII. Integration**: The Fractal Mesh connecting all layers.
8.  **VIII. Soul**: The Narrative Engine and Evolutionary emotional intelligence.
9.  **IX. Reciprocity**: The Ledger of Gratitude and shared value.
10. **X. Development**: The Roadmap and collaborative skills hub.
11. **XI. Support**: The Gift Economy and resource fuel.
12. **XII. Contact**: Signal & Feedback.
13. **XIII. FAQ**: Knowledge Base.
14. **XIV. Volunteer**: Direct Action.

## 🚀 Getting Started
This project is built with pure, "Vanilla" web technologies (HTML5, CSS3) to ensure maximum accessibility and longevity. No complex build chains or heavy frameworks are required.

### Prerequisites
